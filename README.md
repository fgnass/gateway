# gateway
## Node.js middleware to execute CGI scripts

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/fgnass/gateway.png)](http://travis-ci.org/fgnass/gateway)

Purpose of this module is to allow development tools like
[Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) or [Livestyle](https://github.com/One-com/livestyle)
to serve PHP files (and possibly other scripting languages) directly.

To make this work you need the `php-cgi` binaray in your PATH.

## Usage

```javascript
var http = require('http');
var gateway = require('gateway');

var app = http.createServer(gateway(__dirname, {
  '.php': 'php-cgi'
}))
```

### Usage with command line arguments
```javascript
var http = require('http');
var gateway = require('gateway');

var app = http.createServer(gateway(__dirname, {
  '.php': ['php-cgi', '-d', 'auto_prepend_file=/path/to/auto_prepended.php']
  }
}))
```

## Installing php-cgi

The `php-cgi` binary can be installed via Homebrew by tapping the
[homebrew-php](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-php) repository:

    brew tap homebrew/dupes
    brew tap homebrew/versions
    brew tap homebrew/homebrew-php
    brew install php56

## Directories

If the middleware encounters a URL that points to a directory, it will look for
an index file matching any of the registered extensions. If the URL points to a
valid directory but the path does not end with a slash, a permanent redirect is
sent.

The gateway middleware doesn't support `cgi-bin` directories. If you want to
serve CGI scripts with a shebang please use [node-cgi](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-cgi) instead.
